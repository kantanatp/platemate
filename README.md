# platemate: Sustainable Cooking Companion

platemate transcends the conventional boundaries of a recipe ingredient web application by embedding a profound commitment to sustainability. Inspired by the global imperative to reduce food wastage, platemate is designed not only to recognize dishes from uploaded images but also to ingeniously manage leftovers, thereby propelling each culinary journey towards fostering a more sustainable environment.

## About This Project

### Inspiration

platemate is deeply inspired by both our personal journeys, growing up with roots in the rural landscapes of Thailand, where agriculture forms the backbone of the community. Here, where every grain of rice tells a story of hard work, diligence, and perseverance, the ethos of valuing food is instilled from a young age. Many parents, including ours, teach their children that not a single grain of rice should be left uneaten, for each one carries the sweat and hopes of those who harvested it. This profound respect for food and the hard work behind it inspired us and fueled the creation of platemate.

This project is more than just a technological endeavor; it embodies the lessons stemming from the fields of rural Thailand and aims to bridge the gap between modern culinary practices and the timeless values of conserving resources and honoring the efforts of every individual involved in bringing food to our tables. platemate is our message to extend these values to a global audience, leveraging technology to minimize food waste and promote a culture of appreciation and sustainability.


### What We Learned

From ideation to fruition, platemate has taught us the complex layers of image recognition, the intricacies of web scraping, and the essential integration of sustainability within the realm of technology. This dip into AI's realm for precise dish identification, coupled with understanding and implementing web scraping concepts to curate exact ingredient lists from diverse online platforms, has truly been a wonderful and constructive experience.

### How We Built It

platemate combines various technologies, integrating Python and Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly frontend. The web application also utilizes BeautifulSoup4 and Requests for web scraping, Pillow for image processing, and open-source machine learning models for robust image recognition.

### Challenges We Faced

Throughout the development process, we encountered multiple challenges. Ensuring the precision of dish identification and the accuracy of the corresponding ingredients list was the first critical hurdle we faced. We also had to balance including advanced functionalities with maintaining a simplistic user interface, challenging us with design intricacies. Furthermore, integrating sustainability as a core aspect of platemate, while ensuring the platform's scalability, presented a unique set of challenges. Balancing these ambitions with the technical constraints and striving for a seamless user experience was both motivating and demanding.

## Key Features

- **Dish Identification**: Identify your dish with a simple image upload.
- **Ingredient Lists**: Select your desired recipe and reveal a list of ingredients.
- **Leftover Management**: A segment for storing and managing leftovers, contributing to a more sustainable world.

## Moving Forward

Our ambition is to elevate platemate's impact by incorporating the following features:

- **Ingredient Price Comparator**: Introducing a feature to compare prices of different ingredients and portion sizes across various retailers, empowering users to make cost-effective purchasing decisions while planning their meals, promoting both sustainability and savings.

- **Plant-Based Alternatives**: In our mission to further sustainability, we plan to suggest plant-based alternatives for ingredients, encouraging a shift towards more eco-friendly dietary choices and reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional animal-based ingredients.

- **User-Based Platform Enhancements**: Envisioning platemate as a more interactive and personalized platform by offering functionalities such as:
    - **Favorite Dishes**: Allowing users to save and organize their favorite dishes for quick access.
    - **Sustainability Contribution Score**: Implementing a system to score and reward users' efforts in reducing food waste and making sustainable choices, fostering a community of environmentally conscious individuals.
    - **Dish Ratings**: Enabling users to rate dishes, fostering a community-driven approach to sharing and discovering savoring recipes.

These additions are aimed at not just enhancing the user experience but also at making substantial contributions to environmental sustainability and community well-being. We believe that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can be a powerful agent in addressing some of the most pressing challenges, including sustainability and resource conservation.
